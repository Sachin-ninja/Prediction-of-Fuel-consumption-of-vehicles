# Prediction-of-Fuel-consumption-of-vehicles

This Project is to predict the fuel consumed by vehicle using its CO2 emission,No of Cylinders and No. of Cylinders in the Vehicle.User has to give the values,the model predicts the fuel consumed by it based on the values.

Further,the user can input the no. of km's he want to travel,in the blink of an eye the model predicts the amount of fuel to put in car to travel the distance.

The model is trained with Canadian Dataset using Machine Learning Algorithm.
